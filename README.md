Liven up the long miles with automatic Zwift camera control for Windows!

...wish you didn't have to press keys or fiddle with your phone to change views on the big screen?
...wish you could enjoy the view from the drone while riding?
...have you ever forgotten to take photos of your epic ride to upload to your Strava friends and family?

ZCamera is a set-it-and-forget-it, automatic view changer and photo-taker for Zwift which mixes up the perspectives for you.

* Press C to stop and start the automatic changing of views any time you want to have complete control
* Auto-Pause mode detects the presence of chat, route choices and game menus to avoid interfering
* Adjust other preferences in the MyOptions.txt file

Limitations:
* Would be nice if we didn't have to have the "Run as Administrator" prompt to reliably send keystrokes to Zwift
* The method used for detecting when to Auto-Pause can still be improved, to be faster and more accurate at all screen sizes
* The small status message may not appear in a useful place on multi-monitor systems
* Zwift needs to be the active window while you ride

About the (cool, but) experimental Drone View:

* When in Drone view, ZCamera will fly the camera around. 
* Press the 'd' key to start the Drone view manually for 60 seconds (try it out a few times)
* By default, this view is off and is not included in the view rotation

ZCamera works hard to avoid pressing keys when any Zwift menus and controls are active.
But, since the game's drone-flying keystrokes are also used for U-Turns and route changes at intersections, 
Drone view is not recommended for use during important rides (too much at stake!)

Also note that Zwift's Drone feature in the game isn't perfect -- the game allows the camera view to
pass through scenery, under roads, and even inside other player's bodies.   

Set the Odds value for the Drone view to off in MyOptions.txt to disable the drone view
