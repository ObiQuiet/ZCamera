; Primary View
; The camera comes back to this view in between each of the others
; To change the view that is "primary", set PrimayView equal to the name of the other view, e.g. "Default"
; And, set the odds of that view to 0 (otherwise it will be chosen at random, in addition to being the primary view
; -------------------------------------------------------------------

PrimaryView := "FirstPerson"     


; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; Control ZCamera's behavior and your preferences
; -------------------------------------------------------------------

; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; VIEWS
; For each view in this list:
;
; Odds: Contols how often the view will be selected for display  
;    Odds of 0 or off, the view won't be selected
;    Otherwise, Odds is the relative frequency for choosing the view 
;	 The numbers do not need to add up to 100
; 
; MinTime, MaxTime:  In seconds, the amount of time the camera will spend in that view before going back to the Primary View
;    The time spent in the view will vary randomly between these values
;
; TakePic:  true means that ZCamera may take a screenshot while that view is active.  false, it won't.
;
; Key: The Zwift keystroke that switches the game to the view


FirstPerson		:= {Odds:   0, MinTime: 30, MaxTime: 60, TakePic: false, Key: "{NumPad3}"}
                  ; Odds set to 0 since this is the primary view (see above), and we don't want it also chosen at random
						
Side	  		:= {Odds:  20, MinTime:  5, MaxTime: 12, TakePic: yes}
Helicopter  	:= {Odds:  10, MinTime: 10, MaxTime: 30, TakePic: no }
Spectator	 	:= {Odds:  20, MinTime:  7, MaxTime: 12, TakePic: no }
HeadOn	 		:= {Odds:  10, MinTime:  3, MaxTime:  7, TakePic: yes}
RearWheel	 	:= {Odds:   5, MinTime:  3, MaxTime:  7, TakePic: no }
ThirdPerson		:= {Odds: off, MinTime: 10, MaxTime: 20, TakePic: no }
Default			:= {Odds:  20, MinTime: 10, MaxTime: 20, TakePic: yes}
BirdsEye		:= {Odds:  20, MinTime: 15, MaxTime: 30, TakePic: yes}
Drone			:= {Odds: off, MinTime: 10, MaxTime: 30, TakePic: no }
					; In Drone view, ZCamera will move the drone around to change perspective.
					; If you don't want this, set the Odds for the Drone view to 0 or off
					
					; The 'd' key will let you see the Drone pilot in action
					; by enabling it for 60 seconds at a time
					
					; See the EXPERIMENTAL note below for more info

; PICTURES / CAMERA / SCREENSHOTS

; Exactly when pictures are taken depends on which views are set to allow pictures (with the TakePic setting above),
; which view is visible when the interval occurs, and some randomness 
; Set NumberOfPictures to 0 to disable picture taking

FirstPictureDelay := 3   	 ; minutes to wait after ZCamera starts, before it will try to take the first picture 
PictureInterval   := 10  	 ; minimum number of minutes between each picture
NumberOfPictures  := 5	 	 ; the maximum number of pictures ZCamera will take in a session.  
MsgWhenPictureTaken := false ; if true, puts a message on screen when ZCamera has taken a picture.  if off or false, no message

TakePicturesOfAchievements := no  ; ZCamera will try to capture a screen shot when the Unlock and Route Complete achievements appear
                                  ; Set to no to disable this feature 
; -------------------------------------------------------------------
; EXPERIMENTAL: DronePilot
; When in Drone view, ZCamera will fly the camera around.  Which is pretty cool!
;
; Press the 'd' key to start Drone view manually (try it out a few times!)
;
; It does this by pressing the left/right, up/down, +/- keys for you
; It also adjusts the drone's speed based on how far from your avatar the drone is, 
; to minimize the chance of making you dizzy by flying fast in small circles
; 
; While ZCamera works hard to avoid pressing keys when any Zwift menus
; and controls are active, it *could* still happen.  Normally, it's harmless.
;
; But, since the game's drone-flying keystrokes are also used for U-Turns and route changes at intersections, 
; DronePilot is not recommended for use during important rides (too much at stake!)
;
; Also note that Zwift's Drone feature in the game isn't perfect -- the view may pass through scenery, under roads, and
; inside other player's bodies.   
;
; Set the Odds value for the Drone view to off to disable the drone view completely
